    <h2>Social Media <span>Marketing</span></h2>
    <p>
    If your real estate agent is an influencer on social media, he or she has access to thousands of niche buyers who are ready to invest in property. To be an influencer, an agent either needs to dedicate a large chunk of their time to social media or they need to partner with luxury real estate marketing service providers who can put in the work for them. Wouldnâ€™t you rather your agent spent his or her time marketing your property and let an expert handle their social media presence? At <span>Luxury Presence</span>, our dedicated success team utilizes an agentâ€™s stories and feed posts to help them go viral and become an authority in their industry. Once theyâ€™ve harnessed the power of becoming an influencer, they can use their voice to advocate for your home and sell it more quickly than their competitors.

    <h2>Effective Search Engine <span>Optimization</span></h2>
    <p>
    Recent research has shown that 44% of buyers found the home they purchased on the internet. Many of them simply googled the search terms that they wanted in a new home and started their search that way. For your home to show up in these types of searches, your real estate agent needs to use the right terms in your online marketing. The effective use of these terms is referred to as search engine optimization or SEO. The process of identifying and correctly using the right terms is a bit of a scienceâ€”one that the SEO experts at <span>Luxury Presence</span> have mastered. When a potential buyer searches terms that match your home, your property will show up in the results and provide opportunities for the buyer to learn more.

       <h2>Expert Content Production</h2>
<p>Content is one of the most powerful resources a real estate agent has to promote your property. Being able to create high-quality content such as video and copywriting is an essential tool that elevates the agents who use luxury real estate marketing services above their competitors. According to a recent survey, 85 percent of buyers and sellers want to work with an agent who uses videoâ€”and for good reason. An agent who uses video is able to connect with potential buyers on a deeper level and build trust and rapport. When they use video to market your property, they are showing viewers what it would really be like to walk through and live in your homeâ€”something that is much more difficult to do with a written description.

However, written descriptionsâ€”or copywritingâ€”is also important. Your property needs to be described in appealing and vibrant terms on the listing and on any additional marketing that is created to sell it. Those agents who work with Luxury Presence get access to experienced real estate copywriters who create blogs, website copy, and content marketing pieces that make your property attractive to potential buyers.
